# Predict_the_number_of_cylinders_in_a_car
Generate the best classification/regression model to predict the number of cylinders in a car

Main tasks:

1. Find the number of distinct classes/groups through multivariate visualizations.
2. Identify these classes with the help of K-means clustering, Dendograms and Silhoutte plots.
3. Perform preprocessing of data (including splitting into training and testing sets)
4. Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Classification Trees.
5. Use regression algorithms like Least squares, LASSO, SVM and regression trees.
6. Evaluate the performance of all these models and select the best one.
